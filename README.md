Design patterns are established solutions to common problems encountered in object-oriented programming (OOP). They provide reusable templates 
for structuring code that promotes flexibility, maintainability, and readability.
By leveraging these patterns, developers can create well-designed, efficient, and adaptable software systems.

This repo contains simple examples to understand different design patterns.
